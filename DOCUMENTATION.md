# Lilly Technical Challenge Documentation

*This documentation template serves as a place for you to discuss how you approached this challenge, any issues you faced & how you overcame them, or any other points that you feel would be relevant for the interviewers to know. The text in italics is here to guide you - feel free to remove it once you fill out each section!*

## Approach
My first steps were to understand both the system as it was and the objectives I was to complete. After looking through the objectives I decided to put them in what I thought would be the priority order with the functionality first and design later, which happened to be the order the objectives are listed in. After going through the files and objectives I pulled up a couple resources that I have found useful before as well as a youtube tutorial on how to set up Python on VScode. Then after I had set everything up I tested the api endpoints with FastAPI docs, this gave me a much better understanding on what the api's were doing. When I finally started on the objectives it did take me a little bit of time to work out how to navigate the enviorment and python, but with some research I was able to get started fully.  

## Objectives - Innovative Solutions
*For the challenge objectives, did you do anything in a particular way that you want to discuss? Is there anything you're particularly proud of that you want to highlight? Did you attempt some objectives multiple times, or go back and re-write particular sections of code? If so, why? Use this space to document any key points you'd like to tell us about.*

## Problems Faced
*Use this space to document and discuss any issues you faced while undertaking this challenge and how you solved them. We recommend doing this proactively as you experience and resolve the issues - make sure you don't forget! (Screenshots are helpful, though not required)*.

## Evaluation
*How did you feel about the challenge overall? Did some parts go better than others? Did you run out of time? If you were to do this again, and were given more time, what would you do differently?*
I was a little overwhelmed at the beginning with needing to install Python and setting up the vitual enviorment but also determined to complete the objectives to a good standard.
